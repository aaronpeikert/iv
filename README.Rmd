Independend Validation is a procedure proposed by von Oertzen, which produces independend assessment sets. This property is assumed when performing most statistical tests on the performance measures associated with the assesment sets. Importantly classical resampling procedures (like cross validation or bootstrapping) do violate this assumption, because even when the original sample are independend, the resulting assesment and holdout sets are not.
