Description: Independend Validation is a procedure proposed by von Oertzen,
  which produces uncorrelated assessment sets. This property is assumed when
  performing most statistical tests on the performance measures associated
  with the assesment sets. Importantly classical resampling procedures 
  (like cross validation or bootstrapping) do violate this assumption, because
  even though the sample to beginn with are uncorrelated, the resulting
  assesment and holdout sets are not.
